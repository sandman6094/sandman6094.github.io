            </header>

            <p>The Groomers, Michelle and CiCi, have always had experience with dogs in their lives and have raised different breeds of dogs. Since they love pets and have a certain foundation in getting along with pets. Michelle decided to go to Merry-field school to learn pet grooming.</p>
            <br>
            <p>“I hope my career is my hobby.” Said by Michelle. Shortly after she graduated, she did an internship at Pash the canine Boudoir salon which is a very well-known salon for their techniques and reputation. She also worked at fabulous pets and later switched to sunrise animal hospital. She felt that she could learn more about pets by working in a pet hospital then she went to a company called Love & Working at leash salon. Through all years’ working, she learned a lot of experience from their owners, went to work in different places to absorb their techniques and knowledge of grooming pets and pet care, and then decided to open her own grooming shop.</p>
            <br>
            <p>With the help of the experience, she accumulated through all these years and her professional skills, Smiling Leash Pet Grooming gained a lot of returning customers. They are looking forward to serving you and your pets.</p>
